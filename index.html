    <h2 id="p1">Summary</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m Kristina Rajic, coming from Croatia but currently living in Hamburg.
        I would consider myself as a positive person who always strives for more and wants to achieve extraordinary
        things. </p>
    <p> I have wide experience in all areas of marketing, from PR to social media and event management. As a Junior
        Marketing Manager, I was in charge of leading marketing projects & campaigns to attract targeted audiences
        through social media channels. Moreover, I have prior experience in sales and customer support, which helps me
        in listening to the needs of users and making projects that will benefit them.
